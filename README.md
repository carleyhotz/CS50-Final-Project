notes
- When setting up the project, I used a virtual environment, venv, to install the Python packages and stored them in requirements.txt. This helped me set up my project and learn about standard practices, so I can learn to do things the right way and avoid issues with package version issues down the line.
- Originally, my .gitignore file only had /venv to ignore the virtual environment. Then, a folder called "pycache" was auto-generated and I found out what it is and that I should not be tracking it either. I found Github's Python.gitignore and removed the instances of pycache from my repository.
- css: for the tiles, I wanted to have a color palette, so stored the colors in variables inside the stylesheet.
- used w3schools grid example as a baseline, then changed as necessary
